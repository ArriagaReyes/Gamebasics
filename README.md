# BASICS

A simple console game engine.

## Build

My current knowledge on C++ development is limted, currently I'm developing this project on Linux and have zero idea how to build on Windows.

To build, simply `cd` into the project root directory, type `make` in the terminal and hit enter.
To run the project, type `./build` in the terminal and hit enter.
